# Stepper Motor Control Circuit

## Project Description
This project focuses on designing a circuit to control the velocity of a stepper motor using an H-Bridge and an analog PI controller. The circuit includes Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signals generated by a triangular signal generator and a PI controller designed using operational amplifiers. The system was tested using both PSpice simulation and practical implementation.
